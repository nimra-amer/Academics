Problem Statement:

Design a simple network simulation in ns-3 where two nodes are connected by a point-to-point link with the following specifications:

Link Characteristics:

Data Rate: 10 Mbps

Delay: 5 ms


Network Setup:

Node A should send UDP packets to Node B.

The application on Node B should echo any data it receives from Node A.


Packet Characteristics:

Packet size: 512 bytes

Transmission interval: 0.5 seconds

The client should send 5 packets in total.

Tasks:

1. Write the code for the network topology in ns-3.


2. Assign IP addresses to each node in the network.


3. Configure the UDP echo server on Node B and set it to listen on port 8080.


4. Configure the UDP echo client on Node A to send packets to Node B on port 8080.


5. Run the simulation for 10 seconds.


Output
The output should show Node A sending packets to Node B and receiving an echo back.

Verify if all 5 packets were sent and echoed correctly.
